  \brief A specialized FormEntry for a big clickable action.

  This component is used when the Form needs entries that represent a big clickable
  action: they will act like a single big button and is controlled by its Action property.
  Never override the contentItem property for a FormAction.

  Example usage:
  \qml
  import QtQuick.Controls as QQC
  import org.kde.kirigami as Kirigami

  Kirigami.Form {
    Kirigami.FormGroup {
        title: "When Offline:"
        Kirigami.FormAction {
            action: Kirigami.Action {
                icon.name: "offline-settings"
                text: "Offline Settings"
                onTriggered: { Code to open that settings page here }
            }
        }
        ...
    }
